## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview & Proposal

In this project, I aim to tackle the challenge of media bias detection, particularly in an age where information
overload and cognitive biases make it increasingly difficult for individuals to critically analyze the media they
consume.
Drawing on established research in automated bias detection, I plan to build a model that helps identify
potential biases in news articles, primarily as a reminder to remain critical without replacing personal judgment.

### Idea and Approach

The project will be a mix of *Bring Your Own Method* and *Bring Your Own Data*. Existing models, such as MAGPIE
(Horych et al., 2024) and earlier works like from Spinde et al. (2022), have already made significant advancements in
automated media bias detection with deep learning models, particularly for English-language data.
My approach involves adapting these models by simplifying the architecture to make it computationally more feasible
while trying to preserve accuracy.

Key modifications include:

- Replacing MAGPIEâ€™s pre-trained model encoder RoBERTa with DistilBERT, which is more efficient and suitable for the
  available computational resources.
- Simplifying and redesigning MAGPIEâ€™s architecture, leveraging the foundational work of Spinde et al. (2022), whose
  model uses a simpler framework.
- Reducing the number of datasets and tasks in the multitask learning setup to decrease the computational load.

To present my work, I aim to build a simple interface where users can input text and receive bias detection results.
Menzner & Leidner (2024) developed a similar interface using GPT-3.5. However, I will implement the architecture
described above for a more targeted and resource-efficient bias detection solution.

### The Datasets

As mentioned above, in order for the project to be feasible, I will need to simplify the data for the multitask learning
setup.
Therefore, I will use the following datasets from the MAGPIE paper, being the smallest datasets in each task family,
except for the News bias task family:

| Task Family        | Dataset                                 | # sentences | Task                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Subjective bias    | CW_HARD (Hube and Fetahu, 2019)         | 6.843       | Binary Classification      |
| News bias          | BABE (Spinde et al., 2021c)             | 3,672       | Binary Classification      |
| Hate speech        | MeTooMA (Gautam et al., 2020)           | 7,388       | Binary Classification      |
| Gender bias        | GAP (Webster et al., 2018)              | 4,373       | Binary Classification      |
| Sentiment analysis | MDGender (Din et al., 2020)             | 2,332       | Binary Classification      |
| Fake news          | MPQA (Wilson, 2008)                     | 5,508       | Token-Level Classification |
| Emotionally        | GoodNewsEveryone (Bostan et al., 2020)  | 4,428       | Token-Level Classification |
| Group bias         | StereotypeDataset (Pujari et al., 2022) | 2,208       | Binary Classification      |
| Stance detection   | GWSD (Luo et al., 2020)                 | 2,010       | Multi-Class Classification |

The datasets are available in the MAGPIE repository, and I will use the same data preprocessing steps as in the original
paper.

However, the final choice of datasets is subject to change based on the computational resources available and the
model's performance during the hacking phase of the project.

### Target Metric Specification

The error metric for this project is the (Macro) F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
It is chosen, because it is suited for the classification problem at hand and also used in the MAGPIE paper,
which is the basis for this project.

The target for my project however is not the one achieved by MAGPIE, since I chose a simpler setup.
Therefore, the target I take is the one from the other MTL Approach by Spinde et al. (2022),
which is a Macro F1 score of 0.78 for the MTL Model.

### Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture is a simplified version of the MAGPIE model, using DistilBERT as the backbone and a
multitask learning setup with 9 datasets containing 11 Subtasks. The model consists of the following components:

- **Data processing and handling**
- **Tokenizer**
- **Model architecture components**
- **Training components**
- **Source-specific utilities**

The code was taken from the MAGPIE repository and adapted to the chosen setting.
Apart from that, error handling and logging were added,
and the code was modularized in a slightly different way.

### Training and Evaluation

The process of training the model is as follows:

1. Data Initialization (preprocessed from repository)

2. Train a baseline model with the hyperparameter setting of the MAGPIE paper:
    - pre-finetune the DistilBERT Model on all datasets except for the BABE dataset
    - finetune the model on the BABE dataset (Subtask 1) and compare over different random seeds

3. Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model
   (see next chapter for details)

4. Train and evaluate the final model with the optimal hyperparameters

### Results

All training steps were done on my computer (MacBook Air M2, 16GB RAM, 8 cores)
and the results were tracked with wandb.

#### Baseline Model

##### Pre Finetuning Results (plots from wandb):

![img.png](plots/prefinetuning_combined_train_dev_loss.png)
![img.png](plots/prefinetuning_dev_f1.png)

- 100 steps for pre-finetuning, should be increased, loss is still "moving around" quite a lot
- Some tasks perform very bad, with F1 Scores under 0.5:
    - MeTooMA (108, F1 <0.1)
    - MDGender (116, F1 <0.35)
    - Stereotype (109 subtask 2, F1 <0.45)

##### Finetuning with BABE (over 30 seeds, plots from wandb):

Mean Test F1: 68,77%
Max Test F1: 71,43%
![img_3.png](plots/finetuning_BABE_train_loss.png)
![img_3.png](plots/finetuning_BABE_dev_f1_mean.png)
![img_3.png](plots/finetuning_BABE_test.png)

- 50 steps for finetuning, should be increased, loss is still "moving around" quite a lot

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Since in the MAGPIE repository, they already did a hyperparameter tuning for the subtasks for:

- Learning rate
- Max epochs and
- Early stopping patience,

I will use the hyperparameters from the MAGPIE paper for both, pre-finetuning and finetuning
and increase the number of max_steps to 500 in comparison to my baseline,
as well as the warmup steps to 10% of the max_steps for the pre-finetuning.

For the finetuning step, I will do a hyperparameter optimization with a grid search
for the following parameters:

- Dropout rate for regularization
- Batch size variations
- Warmup steps for learning rate scheduler

Results:
![img.png](plots/hpo_finetuning_BABE_10001.png)
![img_2.png](plots/hpo_finetuning_parameter_importance.png)

- Best configuration: dropout_rate: 0.1, batch_size: 64 for 01, warmup_steps: 100 (for 500 steps)

### Final Model Results

... coming soon, still running

### Open Issues

- Did not build a proper CI pipeline (only manual testing)
- Config File for hyperparameters etc. not in a good format and should be in a different place
- Better organization of the scripts necessary
- Better documentation of the code and the repository

## âœ… TODO's (for third phase)

- [ ] Savel final Model and Build Inference Pipeline
- [ ] Build interface for model
- [ ] Write final report
