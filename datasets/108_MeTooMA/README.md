### 108 MeTooMA

- This dataset contains `9973 TweetIDs` collected between October and December 2018 as well as annotations for
  `['Country', 'Relevance', 'Directed_Hate', 'Generalized_Hate', 'Sarcasm','Allegation', 'Justification', 'Refutation', 'Support', 'Oppose']`.
  These labels fall into 5 categories:
  `Relevance, stance (Support, Oppose), Hate Speech (directed, generalized), Sarcasm and Dialogue acts (Allegation, Justification, Refutation`.
  We were able to retrieve `7874` tweets.
  We applied our usual tweet-preparation method, but did not remove Hashtags.
  We discarded the columns `Country and Relevance` as they are only useful to filter the dataset for other downstream
  tasks.
  We modelled 4 different subtasks:
    - `Stance detection`: Regression, whether the tweet opposes `(-1)`, supports `(+1)` the MeToo-movement or is neutral
      `(0)`.
    - `Hate Speech detection`: `Our primary label`. Binary classification. We collapsed the labels for `directed` and
      `generalized` Hate speech (`1=Hate Speech, 0=no Hate Speech`).
    - `Sarcasm`: Binary classification `(0=no sarcasm, 1=sarcasm)`.
    - `Dialogue acts`: Multi-label classification where each column of
      `['allegation_label', 'justification_label', 'refutation_label']` contains the binary label indicating its class
      affiliation.
- Domain of the labels:
    - `text`: The preprocessed text of the tweet.
    - `oppose_support_label`: Multiclass label `(-1=oppose, 0=neutral, 1=support)`.
    - `hate_speech_label`: Binary label.
    - `sarcasm_label`: Binary label.
    - `Remaining columns`: Binary labels indicating class affiliation for multi-label classification.
