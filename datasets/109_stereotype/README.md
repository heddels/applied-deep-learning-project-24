  The authors define implicit stereotypical association as
  `Text that is not mainly intended to convey a stereotype but nevertheless propagates a stereotypical association.`
  The authors sampled candidate expressions from the subreddits `/r/Jokes` and `/r/AskHistorians` and label the
  sentences using Amazon Turk.
  We collapse `explicit and implicit` stereotypes.
