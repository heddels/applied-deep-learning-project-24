### BABE - Bias Annotations By Experts

- binary classification (biased - not biased)
- A robust and diverse data set created by trained experts, for media bias research. It consists of 3,700 sentences
  balanced among topics and outlets, containing media bias labels on the word and sentence level. To get the labels,
  rater were trained in a structured process over half a year. Labels are based on a majority vote, where BABE offers
  higher annotator agreement than most media bias datatsets.
- preprocessing steps: None
- final size: `3.700`
- Domain of the labels:
    - `text`: The plain text containing a sentence.
    - `biased words`: The dataset also contains annotations about which words in each sentence the reviewers perceived
      as being biased.
    - `label`: The main binary label on the sentence level. `1=negative, 2=positive`.
